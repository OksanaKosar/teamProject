            <h2 class="mb-4">Overview</h2>
            <p>This application is designed to work with BMP files, offering users a variety of functionalities,
                including creating new BMP files based on existing ones using different construction algorithms and
                color schemes, as well as embedding and extracting hidden text messages. Additionally, the program
                provides a user-friendly interface with the ability to save recent settings and files.</p>

        <div class="text-left">
            <h4 class="mt-4">Visual Interface:</h4>
            <p>The application has an intuitive visual interface, ensuring easy navigation and use of all available
                functions.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Selecting and Creating BMP Files:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can select an existing BMP file through a system file selection dialog.</li>
                <li>Based on the selected file, users can create a new BMP file using one of three available
                    construction algorithms and three color schemes.
                </li>
                <li>The new BMP files can be saved through a system save file dialog, allowing users to choose the
                    location and name for the new file.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Principles of Image Construction:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spiral Drawing:</strong> This method calculates the color of each pixel based on its
                    distance from the origin and its angle. Different color combinations are generated by modulating
                    these values.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Combination 1:</strong> Distance, Angle, and the sum of Distance and Angle modulo 256.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Combination 2:</strong> Angle, the sum of Distance and Angle modulo 256, and Distance.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Combination 3:</strong> The sum of Distance and Angle modulo 256, Distance, and Angle.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Diamond Drawing(Astroid):</strong> This method generates a diamond shape centered in the
                    image. The
                    color is determined based on the pixel's position relative to the diamond's shape.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Combination 1:</strong> Red for inside the diamond, white otherwise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combination 2:</strong> Green for inside the diamond, white otherwise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combination 3:</strong> Blue for inside the diamond, white otherwise.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rose Drawing:</strong> This method uses a mathematical rose curve to determine the color of
                    each pixel. The color is based on the value of the rose curve at that point.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Combination 1:</strong> The red channel is the normalized value of the rose curve, the
                        green channel is half of this value, and the blue channel is a third of this value. This creates
                        a gradient effect with a dominance of red, followed by green and blue.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Combination 2:</strong> The green channel is the normalized value of the rose curve, the
                        red channel is half of this value, and the blue channel is a third of this value. This shifts
                        the color dominance to green, followed by red and blue.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Combination 3:</strong> The blue channel is the normalized value of the rose curve, the
                        green channel is half of this value, and the red channel is a third of this value. This shifts
                        the color dominance to blue, followed by green and red.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p>Each color scheme provides a unique way to visualize the patterns generated by the construction
                algorithms, offering a variety of visual effects for the created BMP files.</p>


            <h4 class="mt-4">Message Embedding:</h4>
            <p>Users can "invisibly" embed a short text message into a BMP file by breaking down the byte information
                into bits and writing them into the least significant bits of the BMP file's color map bytes.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Message Extraction:</h4>
            <p>The application allows for the extraction of hidden text messages from BMP files, reconstructing the
                original text from the bits written into the file.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Authorization:</h4>
            <p>The application supports user authorization with a username and password. Upon successful authorization,
                the last settings and files used are saved and restored.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Activity History:</h4>
            <p>For authorized users, the application saves the last three:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>BMP files worked on;</li>
                <li>Modes of creating new bitmaps;</li>
                <li>Messages embedded in BMP files;</li>
                <li>Messages extracted from BMP files.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Automatic Restoration:</h4>
            <p>After authorization, users can continue working with the last settings or choose from one of the last
                three modes/files/messages used.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Deauthorization:</h4>
            <p>Users can deauthorize at any time while retaining the current program settings.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Additional Information:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>User Manual: Detailed explanations on how to use all the functions of the application.</li>
